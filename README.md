# FitScope [&nbsp;&nbsp;‚óπ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;](https://liviu-boros.github.io/fit-scope/)

Welcome to FitScope, a personal project in which I am studying UX design for mobile within the context of the fitness ecosystem.
‚ßÅ‚ãô‚©∫‚ù±üåê‚§§
In this project, I have created a custom design system for a fitness app, detailing colors, fonts, icons, components, and patterns. The presentation consists of several sections of high fidelity screens and task flows, including:

- The **design system**, which outlines the overall look and feel of the app
- The **exercises page**, which showcases individual exercises and their associated information
- The **workouts page**, which displays pre-made workouts and allows users to customize their own
- The **planner page**, which enables users to plan and schedule their workouts
- The **current workout page**, which allows users to track and log their progress during their workouts

I hope you enjoy exploring the FitScope project!
